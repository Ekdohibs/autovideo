This program is a Blender add-on to semi-automate the edition of videos. It is
designed with one specific use case in mind: the dance shows at ENS Paris. As
such, the available documentation is in English (see `MANUAL` for installation
and usage instructions). If this is useful to you, you are welcome to use it and
submit pull requests with extra features. If not -- just walk by :-).
